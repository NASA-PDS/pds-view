      <p>This section describes how to install the Registry Client software contained in the <i>${project.artifactId}</i> package. The following topics can be found in this section:

    <section name="System Requirements">
      <p>The Registry Core software was developed using Python and will run on any platform with a supported Python installation. It is compatible with Python 2.6 or 2.7. It is not compatible with Python 2.5 or earlier versions, nor with Python 3 or later versions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="Deploying the Application">
      <p>By far, the easiest way to install the Registry Client (pds.registry) is to use the Python utilities <a href="http://pip.openplans.org/" target="_blank">pip</a> or <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall" target="_blank">easy_install</a>. As a privileged user, install the package with one of the following commands:
      </p>

      <source>
% pip install pds.registry
or 
% easy_install pds.registry
    </source>

    <p>The software as well as its dependencies will be downloaded and installed automatically. Of course, you can use it in <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/" target="_blank">virtualenvs</a> and <a href="http://www.buildout.org/" target="_blank">buildouts</a> too. If neither <i>pip</i> nor <i>easy_install</i> are available on your system, just install the package from source. Download the package from the PDS <a href="ftp://pds.nasa.gov/pub/toplevel/2010/registry/" target="_blank">FTP</a> site. Unpack the selected distribution file with the following command:
    </p>

      <source>
% tar -xzvf pds.registry-1.8.1.tar.gz
      </source>

      <p>In the extracted directory, perform the following command as a privileged user to install the package:
      </p>

      <source>
% python setup.py install
      </source>

      <p>The package is now ready to utilize in your Python applications.
