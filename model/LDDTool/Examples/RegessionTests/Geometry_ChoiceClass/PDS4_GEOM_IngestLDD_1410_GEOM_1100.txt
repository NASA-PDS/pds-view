   name                   geometry_reference_time
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Date_Time_YMD_UTC
   description            geometry_reference_time is the time at which each of the values in the containing class is correct. 

   name                   coordinate_system_type
   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The coordinate_system_type distinguishes between options such as rectangular, spherical, planetocentric, etc. 
   nillable               true
   permissible value - value meaning
      Cartesian - The coordinate system uses rectangular coordinates. 
      Azimuth-Elevation - The coordinate system uses azimuth-elevation coordinates. Azimuth: angle from +X axis to projection of position vector on x-y plane increases in clockwise direction (-180 to +180). Elevation: angle between position vector and x-y plane (-90 to +90). 
      Spherical - The coordinate system uses spherical coordinates. Longitude: angle from +X axis to projection of position vector on X-Y plane increases in clockwise direction (0 to 360). Colatitude: angle between +Z axis and position vector (0 to 180). 
      Planetocentric - The coordinate system uses planetocentric coordinates. Planetocentric longitude increases positively eastward (-180 to +180). Planetocentric latitude increases positively northward (-90 to +90). For planets and their satellites the +Z axis (+90 latitude) always points to the north side of the invariable plane (the plane whose normal vector is the angular momentum vector of the solar system). For dwarf planets, asteroids and comets the IAU defines their positive pole such that their spin is in the right hand sense about their positive pole. The positive pole may point above or below the invariable plane of the solar system. This revision by the IAU Working Group (2006) inverts what had been the direction of the north pole for Pluto, Charon and Ida. 
      Planetodetic - The coordinate system uses planetodetic coordinates. For planets and their satellites the +Z axis (+90 latitude) always points to the north side of the invariable plane (the plane whose normal vector is the angular momentum vector of the solar system). Planetodetic longitude increases positively eastward (-180 to +180). Planetodetic latitude is tied to a reference ellipsoid. For a point, P, on a reference ellipsoid, angle measured from X-Y plane to the surface normal at the point of interest. For other points, equals latitude at the nearest point on the reference ellipsoid. Increases positively northward (-90 to +90). 
      Planetographic - The coordinate system uses planetographic coordinates. For planet and satellite planetographic coordinate systems: Planetographic longitude is usually defined such that the sub-observer longitude increases with time as seen by a distant, fixed observer (0 to 360). The earth, moon and sun are exceptions; planetographic longitude is positive east by default (0 to 360). Planetographic latitude is planetodetic latitude (-90 to +90). For dwarf planets, asteroids and comets: there are multiple, inconsistent standards. Currently, for these objects, PDS permits planetographic coordinates to be provided in addition to, not in lieu of, either planetocentric or planetodetic coordinates.

   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The emission_angle element provides the value of the angle between the surface normal vector at the intercept point and a vector from the intercept point to the spacecraft. The emission_angle varies from 0 degrees when the spacecraft is viewing the subspacecraft point (nadir viewing) to 90 degrees when the intercept is tangent to the surface of the target body. Thus, higher values of emission_angle indicate more oblique viewing of the target. Values in the range of 90 to 180 degrees are possible for ring data.

   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The incidence_angle element provides a measure of the lighting condition at the intercept point. Incidence angle is the angle between the local vertical at the intercept point (surface) and a vector from the intercept point to the sun. The incidence_angle varies from 0 degrees when the intercept point coincides with the subsolar point to 90 degrees when the intercept point is at the terminator (i.e., in the shadowed or dark portion of the target body). Thus, higher values of incidence_angle indicate the existence of a greater number of surface shadows. Note: In PDS labels for Magellan's altimetry and radiometry products, and for Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Mini-RF products, incidence_angle is defined as the value of the angle between the local vertical and the spacecraft direction. For Magellan this is measured at the center of the radiometer footprint at rad_spacecraft_epoch_time.

   description            The phase_angle element provides a measure of the relationship between the instrument viewing position and incident illumination (such as solar light). Phase_angle is measured at the target; it is the angle between a vector to the illumination source and a vector to the instrument. If not specfied, the target is assumed to be at the center of the instrument field of view. If illumination is from behind the instrument, phase_angle will be small.

   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The instrument_azimuth attribute specifies the value for an instrument's rotation in the horizontal direction. It is usually measured from some kind of low hard stop. Although it may be used for any instrument where it makes sense, it is primarily intended for use in surface-based instruments that measure pointing in terms of azimuth and elevation. When in a group, defines the azimuth (horizontal rotation) at which the instrument is pointed. This value is expressed using the coordinate system referred to by REFERENCE_COORD_SYSTEM_NAME and REFERENCE_COORD_SYSTEM_INDEX contained within the same group. The interpretation of exactly what part of the instrument is being pointed is mission-specific. It could be the boresight, the camera head direction, the CAHV camera model A vector direction, or any of a number of other things. As such, for multimission use this value should be used mostly as an approximation, e.g. identifying scenes which might contain a given object.

   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The solar_azimuth attribute specifies one of two angular measurements indicating the direction to the Sun as measured from a specific point on the surface of a planet (ex., from a lander or rover). The positive direction of the elevation is set by the positive_azimuth_direction attribute in the reference coordinate space. The azimuth is measured positively in the clockwise direction (as viewed from above) with the meridian passing through the positive spin axis of the planet (i.e., the north pole) defining the zero reference.

   name                   Quaternion_Base
   description            The Quaternion_Base class defines a quaternion that represents rotation between two right-handed reference frames. In this dictionary, quaternions are always constructed so that the application of the quaternion describes the rotation of one frame to a second frame. The two frames and the direction of rotation must be identified unambiguously in the enclosing classes. Quaternions are expressed as a set of four numbers in the order (qcos, qsin1, qsin2, qsin3), where qcos = cos(theta/2) and qsin(n) = sin(theta/2)*a(n). Theta is the angle of rotation and a is the unit vector (x,y,z) around which the rotation occurs. A document providing the full mathematical basis for this construction, along with examples, and a summary of common pitfalls, is in preparation. The current version can be obtained by contacting the PDS Engineering Node. [mkg: When it is finished we'll ingest it into the registry and refer to it by LID]

   name                   Image_Display_Geometry
   description            Image_Display_Geometry class provides an unambiguous description of the orientation of the image contents. Given an image, displayed as described by the Display_Direction class, any one of the Object_Orientation_* classes should allow unambiguous orientation of the contents of the image. The use of disp:Display_Direction is optional, but must be given either here or in the Display Discipline Area of the label. The Object_Orientation_North_East class is typically used for instruments for which the entire field of view is a portion of the target surface (e.g., instruments on Mars orbital spacecraft); otherwise use Object_Orientation_RA_Dec (e.g., flyby missions, missions with orbit radii much larger than the target radius such as Voyager or Cassini). At least one of these must be used. The three _Identification classes used here are Central_Body (e.g., Saturn if you are using Planetocentric or planetographic coordinates in the Saturn system); Body is typically used in lieu of Central_Body when the coordinates are based on a comet, asteroid, KBO, or satellite; Target when the described object in the FoV is not the Central_Body or Body. For example giving the orientation of the pole of Enceladus in Saturn Planetocentric coordinates, Central_Body = Saturn, Target = Enceladus. Bottom line: put in enough information so someone else can figure out the orientation of the field of view.

   description            The Geometry_Orbiter class is a container for geometric information (positions, velocities, orientations, etc.) relevant to orbiter or flyby spacecraft observations. Specify a value for Reference_Frame_Identification at this level only when a single reference frame is used in the contained classes. If more that one reference frame is used, specify them in the contained classes. If any of the contained classes or attributes have central body, and or target in the class or attribute name (e.g., spacecraft_to_central_body_distance, Spacecraft_To_Target_Position_Vector_Planetocentric), then the central body and or target must be identified in this class. If more than one target or central body need to be identified to fully describe the data, use multiple instances of the Geometry_Orbiter class. Do not use Coordinate_System at this level if more than one coordinate system is used in the contained classes. If more than one coordinate system is used, specify Coordinate_System in each of the subordinate classes where it is appropriate.

   name                   CAHV_Model
   description            The CAHV camera model is equivalent to the standard linear photogrammetric model for a pinhole camera, It is useful for very small field of view cameras and as a building block for more complex camera models. The CAHV model consists of four 3-vectors: C, A, H, and V. Vector C gives the location of the pinhole. Vector A gives the camera axis, defined as the normal to the image plane. Vector H encodes the horizontal axis of the image plane (H'), the coor- dinate (Hc) of the image column at the optical center of the image plane, and the horizontal focal length (Hs) of the camera, in pixels. Vector V encodes corresponding information (V', Vc, Vs) in the vertical direction. The angle (theta) between horizontal and vertical vectors H' and V' is about 90 degrees.

   name                   CAHVOR_Model
   description            The CAHVOR model describes a camera with radial lens distortion about the lens axis. In addition to the CAHV parameters, it includes 3-vectors O and R. Vector O is the optical axis of the lens, slightly different from vector A due to imperfect lens mounting. A ray from a point in space, passing through the pinhole, bends at the pinhole according to a function of the angle between the ray and optical axis O. The function is a polynomial whose coefficients are stored in vector R.

   name                   Motion_Counter
   description            The Motion_Counter class provides a set of integers which describe a (potentially) unique location (position / orientation) for a rover or other movable object. Each time an event occurs that results in a movement, a new motion counter value is created. This includes intentional motion due to drive commands, as well as potential motion due to other articulating devices, such as arms or antennae. This motion counter (or part of it) is used as a reference to define instances of coordinate systems which can move such as SITE or ROVER frames. The motion counter is defined in a mission-specific manner. Although the original intent was to have incrementing indices (e.g., MER), the motion counter could also contain any integer values which conform to the above definition, such as time or spacecraft clock values.
