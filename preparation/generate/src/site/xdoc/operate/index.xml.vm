    <section name="Tool Setup">
      <p>In order to execute the Generate Tool, the user's environment must first be configured appropriately. This section describes how to setup the user environment on UNIX-based and Windows machines.
      </p>

      <subsection name="UNIX-Based Setup">
        <p>This section details the environment setup for UNIX-based machines. The preferred method is to specify the shell script, <i>PDS4Generate</i>, on the command-line. Setting the <i>PATH</i> environment variable to the location of the script, enables the shell script to be executed from any location on the user's machine.
        </p>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>PATH</i> environment variable, by appending to its current setting:
        </p>

        <source>
% setenv PATH ${PATH}:$HOME/${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}/bin
        </source>

        <p>The tool can now be executed via the shell script as demonstrated in the following example:
        </p>

        <source>
% PDS4Generate &lt;command-line arguments&gt;
        </source>

        <p>Additional methods for setting up a UNIX-based environment can be found in the <a href="index-unix.html">UNIX Setup Options</a> section. If viewing this document in PDF form, see the appendix for details.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Windows Setup">
        <p>This section details the environment setup for Windows machines. The preferred method is to specify the batch file, <i>PDS4Generate.bat</i>, on the command-line. Setting the <i>PATH</i> environment variable to the location of the file, enables the batch file to be executed from any location on the user's machine.
        </p>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>PATH</i> environment variable, by appending to its current setting:
        </p>

        <source>
C:\&gt; set PATH = %PATH%;C:\\${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}\bin
        </source>

        <p>The tool can now be executed via the batch file as demonstrated in the following example:
        </p>

        <source>
C:\&gt; PDS4Generate &lt;command-line arguments&gt;
        </source>

        <p>Additional methods for setting up a Windows environment can be found in the <a href="index-win.html">Windows Setup Options</a> section. If viewing this document in PDF form, see the appendix for details.
        </p>
      </subsection>
    </section>

    <section name="Tool Execution">
      <p>Generate Tool can be executed in various ways. This section describes how to run the tool, as well as its behaviors and caveats.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Command-Line Options">
        <p>The following table describes the command-line options available:
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr><th>Command-Line Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          <tr><td>-d, --debug</td><td>Directs output to screen, not file.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-f, --file-list</td><td>Specify the path for a file containing a list of file paths for PDS3 Labels</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-h, --help</td><td>Display usage.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-o, --output-file</td><td>Specify an output filename.  Default is PDS3 label name with _pds4 suffix.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-p, --pds3-label</td><td>Specify the file path for the PDS3 Label to be converted to PDS4</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-t, --template</td><td>Specify the file path for the Velocity template for PDS3 -> PDS4 conversion</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-V, --version</td><td>Display application version.</td></tr>
        </table>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Execute Generate Tool">
        <p>This section demonstrates execution of the tool using the command-line options. The examples below execute the tool via the batch/shell script. Alternate methods for executing the tool can be found in the <a href="#Tool_Setup">Tool Setup</a> section.
        </p>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to run the Generate Tool to convert from a PDS3 Label to a PDS4 Label using a Velocity template file and output to standard out:
        </p>

        <source>
% PDS4Generate -d -p &lt;pds3-label-path&gt; -t &lt;velocity-template-path&gt;
        </source>

        <p>The following command demonstrates how to run the Generate Tool to convert from a PDS3 Label to a PDS4 Label using a Velocity template file and output to a file:
        </p>

        <source>
% PDS4Generate -p &lt;pds3-label-path&gt; -t &lt;velocity-template-path&gt;
        </source>

	<p>The output would go into a file &lt;pds3-label-path&gt;_pd4</p>
