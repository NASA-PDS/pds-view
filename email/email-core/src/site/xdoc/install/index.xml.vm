    <section name="System Requirements">
      <p>This section details the system requirements for installing and developing with the Email Core software.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Java Runtime Environment">
        <p>The Email Core software was developed using Java and will run on any platform with a supported Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The software was specifically compiled for Java version 1.8 and has been tested with this version and version 1.8. The following commands test the local Java installation in a UNIX-based environment:
        </p>

        <source>
% which java
/usr/bin/java

% java -version
java version "1.8.0_101"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_101-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode)
        </source>

        <p>The first command above checks whether the <i>java</i> executable is in the environment's path and the second command reports the version. If Java is not installed or the version is not at least 1.8, Java will need to be downloaded and installed in the current environment. Consult the local system administrator for installation of this software. For the do-it-yourself crowd, the Java software can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/" target="_blank">Oracle Java Download</a> page. The suggested software package is the Java Standard Edition (SE) 8, either the JDK or the JRE package. The JDK package is not necessary to run the software but could be useful if development and compilation of Java software will also occur in the current environment.
        </p>
      </subsection>
    </section>

    <section name="Unpacking the Package">
      <p>Download the <i>${project.artifactId}</i> package from the PDS <a href="ftp://pds.nasa.gov/pub/toplevel/2010/email" target="_blank">FTP</a> site. The binary distribution is available in identical zip or tar/gzip packages. The installation directory may vary from environment to environment but in UNIX-based environments it is typical to install software packages in the <i>/usr/local</i> directory and in Windows-based environments it is typical to install software packages in the <i>C:\Program Files</i> directory. Unpack the selected binary distribution file with one of the following commands:
      </p>

      <source>
% unzip ${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-bin.zip
or
% tar -xzvf ${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-bin.tar.gz
      </source>

      <p>Note: Depending on the platform, the native version of <i>tar</i> may produce an error when attempting to unpack the distribution file because many of the file paths are greater than 100 characters. If available, the GNU version of tar will resolve this problem. If that is not available or cannot be installed, the zipped package will work just fine in a UNIX environment.
      </p>

      <p>The commands above will result in the creation of the <i>${project.artifactId}-${project.version}</i> directory with the following directory structure:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>README.txt</b><br/>
          <p>A README file directing the user to the available documentation for the project.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>LICENSE.txt</b><br/>
          <p>The copyright notice from the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology</a> detailing the restrictions regarding the use and distribution of this software. Although the license is strictly worded, the software has been classified as Technology and Software Publicly Available (TSPA) and is available for <i>anyone</i> to download and use.

        </li>
        <li><b>doc/</b><br/>
          <p>
            This directory contains a local web site with the Email Core documentation, javadoc, unit test results and other configuration management information. Just point the desired web browser to the <i>index.html</i> file in this directory.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>lib/</b><br/>
          <p>
            This directory contains the dependent JAR files for the Email Core software along with the executable jar file (${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.jar) containing the Email Core library. 
          </p>
