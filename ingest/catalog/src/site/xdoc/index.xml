    <section name="About Catalog Tool">
      <p>The Catalog Tool provides functionality for ingesting PDS3 catalog files into the PDS4 infrastructure (Registry Service). Catalog Tool offers three functions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Compare a Catalog Submission<br/>
          <p>The comparison function is intended for both Discipline Node and Engineering Node Data Engineers to determine the differences between previous submissions and a current submission.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Validate a Catalog Submission<br/>
          <p>The validation function is also intended for both Discipline Node and Engineering Node Data Engineers to validate a current submission including checks for referential integrity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Ingest a Catalog Submission<br/>
          <p>The ingestion function is intended for the Engineering Node Operator to ingest the current submission into the PDS Registry Service.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The following diagram details the interfaces for the Catalog Tool when installed in the Engineering Node environment and supporting ingestion into the PDS4 infrastructure:

      <p>The Catalog Tool utilizes the Storage and Product Services for ingesting and retrieving catalog files. Once the tool has determined which catalog files have been updated, the resulting PDS4 products are registered with the Registry Service.
