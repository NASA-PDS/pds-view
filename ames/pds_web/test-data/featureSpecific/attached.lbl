The data and associated PDS labels and catalog files are organized into the   
        following directories:                                                
                                                                              
catalog - contains PDS catalog files for the data set, the instrument, the    
        instrument host (which is the spacecraft, observatory, or laboratory  
        where the instrument was located), and and a listing of references.   
                                                                              
data - contains the data files and their corresponding labels.                
                                                                              
document - contains ancillary documents and files related to this data set    
        including the file sent to Abstract Data Service (ADS).               
                                                                              
index - contains the PDS required index. It lists various parameters for each 
        data file in the data set.
