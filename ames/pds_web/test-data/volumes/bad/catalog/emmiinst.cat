  ===================                                                         
  EMMI is a flexible instrument which allows a wide range of observing        
  modes, from wide-field imaging to high-dispersion echelle                   
  spectroscopy, including long-slit and multi-object spectroscopy.            
  This manual also describes SUSI (SUperb Seeing Imager) which is             
  mounted in the other Nasmyth focus of the NTT and complements the           
  imaging capabilities of EMMI.  A brief description of the active            
  optics system of the NTT and its basic operational principles are           
  also provided in this manual.                                               
                                                                              
  The driving concepts in the instrument definition were the high             
  image quality foreseen for the NTT, the need to complement or               
  improve on the instrumentation on the 3.6m telescope, and the need          
  to minimize instrument change-overs.  The concept which was adopted         
  is that of a dual-beam instrument, fully dioptric, and based on the         
  white pupil principle.  CCD detectors were foreseen for the two arms        
  with the possibility to adapt to the geometric characteristics of           
  future detectors by changing the cameras only.  The main advantages         
  of this type of design are the high efficiency in both channels and         
  the easy conversion from wide field imaging to grism and grating            
  spectroscopy.                                                               
                                                                              
  After the first observations with the NTT, it became clear that the         
  telescope and the atmosphere at La~Silla could provide stellar              
  images with diameters as good as 0.3 arcsec.  Images of this quality        
  could not be sampled adequately with EMMI, which scale had also to          
  be adapted to the spectroscopic modes of observation.  Thus, SUSI           
  was designed and built for the other Nasmyth arm of the NTT.  The           
  design is such that switching between EMMI and SUSI is done in a            
  matter of minutes, so that they can be considered as different parts        
  of the same instrument.                                                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Optics

  A detailed description of the optical design of EMMI can be found in        
  Dekker et al. (1986).                                                       
                                                                              
  It has two 'arms' with separate detectors. One arm ('EMMI blue arm')        
  is coated for high efficiency in the region 300 to 500 nm, the other        
  ('EMMI red arm') for 400 to 1000~nm.  Each arm supports several             
  different observing modes.  The capabilities of the blue and the red        
  arm are not identical, e.g. Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) is only         
  available in the red arm.                                                   
                                                                              
  Each of the two arms has two possible light paths: one is used for          
  grating spectroscopy and the other for imaging and (only in the red         
  arm) low-resolution spectroscopy using grisms.  In grating                  
  spectroscopy, a dichroic can be inserted into the beam allowing the         
  use of both arms at the same time. Each of the five possible light          
  paths (two per arm plus the dichroic mode) is called an 'Observing          
  Mode'. The five modes are called:

  EMMI works with two scientific CCD cameras, one at the red arm and          
  one in the blue arm.                                                        
                                                                              
  The image scale at the F/11 Nasmyth foci of the NTT is 5.36                 
  arcsec/mm or 186 micron per arc sec.  This is also the scale of the         
  direct imaging with SUSI.  The actual field size and scale depend on        
  the detector and camera being used and are given in

  Saturation is in most cases defined by the ADU converter, at 65             
  kADU. The actual well depth is around 2 x 10^6 e so that the                
  linearity is good up to digital saturation. The exceptions are EMMI         
  red and SUSI when read out in fast mode. For EMMI red in the fast           
  mode, exposure levels should be kept below 40 kADU, and for SUSI            
  below 24kADU. Otherwise, the linearity of the CCD is better than            
  0.5%. The measured linearity curves can be found in the CCD test            
  reports.                                                                    
                                                                              
  The fast readout mode has as main advantage a reduced readout time.         
  This becomes important on EMMI red where fast readout saves two             
  minutes. It is much less important in SUSI. The disadvantage is             
  increased readout noise and digitization noise, and sometimes               
  increased electric interference. For broadband imaging and many             
  spectroscopic programmes, the readout noise is not important                
  compared to the photon background, and the fast readout mode would          
  be recommended.  Electronic interference could be larger in fast            
  readout:  when in doubt, it is worthwile to take a few biases in the        
  afternoon to check on the readout noise and on the presence of              
  pattern noise.  Remember that, in general, calibration frames such          
  as bias, flat fields, and darks taken with slow readout cannot be           
  used for correcting fast exposures, and vice versa.                         
                                                                              
  CCDs have an electronic bias that can be evaluated by averaging             
  several 0s dark exposures and subtracted from the science images to         
  take it out. By using these exposures the observer can check the CCD        
  readout noise and possible pick-up patterns in the electronic               
  background.  At least one, but if possible more, long (at least 1           
  hour) dark exposures are important to monitor the dark current of           
  the CCD (if possible, take a dark longer than the longest science           
  exposure).                                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Filters                                                                     
  =======                                                                     
  EMMI has four filter wheels: the blue and red imaging filter wheels,        
  and the blue and the red below-slit wheels. The last two are only           
  used for grating spectroscopy and usually contain neutral density           
  filters only. Each of the two filter wheels used for imaging has 9          
  positions of which 8 are available for mounting filters and one is          
  kept free. The R-filter is usually needed for focusing.  Both red           
  and blue filters have a free circular diameter of 80 mm and an              
  outside diameter of 85~mm.  Adapter trays are available for filters         
  of other instruments (e.g. EFOSC) but use of smaller filters will           
  produce vignetted images only useful in the centre of the CCD.  In          
  such cases it might be better to use SUSI.                                  
                                                                              
  The SUSI filterwheel has 8 positions of which 7 are available for           
  filters.  In contrast to EMMI, SUSI uses 60-mm filters which are the        
  same size as the ones used for EFOSC. EFOSC filters can therefore           
  also be mounted in SUSI (if they are not required by the EFOSC              
  observer!).  There are also a large number of 60-mm filters which           
  are not allocated to a particular instrument and which can be               
  requested.                                                                  
                                                                              
  All filters are permanently mounted in special cells which make             
  replacement very easy.  EMMI red-arm filters, which are inserted in         
  a parallel beam, are mounted at 5 degree inclination to avoid               
  reflections between the CCD and the filter.  Blue arm filters, used         
  in the converging beam in front of the blue camera, do not show this        
  effect and hence are mounted with no inclination.  Using a red-arm          
  filter in the blue will result in a slight change of the central            
  wavelength and will cause some astigmatism. If a blue filter is used        
  in the red arm, every object in the field produces a ghost due to           
  the mentioned reflections, which is about 5 magnitudes fainter than         
  the original object. Thus, although it is possible to use blue              
  filters in the red and vice-versa (one might want to do this in the         
  overlap region, 400 to 500 nm), filters should normally be used in          
  the wheel they are intended for.                                            
                                                                              
  Filters with very narrow bandwidths are not really suitable for the         
  red arm. Because the filters are mounted in the parallel beam, the          
  central wavelength will change across the field. In extreme cases,          
  the central wavelength may be outside the filter response near the          
  edge of the CCD.  The tabulated wavelength corresponds to the centre        
  of the CCD. The effect is further described in Chapter 11. As a             
  guide line, avoid filters with wavelength change <5 nm for                  
  wide-field imaging.  This effect also affects wide-field photometry         
  if using narrow filters.                                                    
                                                                              
  The ESO Image Quality Filters Catalogue (Gilliotte, 1992) contains a        
  list of available filters and transmission curves.  More recently           
  (1995), a number of new filters have been acquired and all                  
  transmission curves re-measured.  This new data can be viewed using         
  the MIDAS graphical user interface (GUI) {\tt FILTERS}, available in        
  MIDAS version 94NOV or later. The most recent version is always             
  available in La Silla. Lists of standard EMMI filters are also given        
  in Chapters 5 (RILD) and 6 (BIMG), respectively (Tables 5.1 and

  manual).                                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Calibration                                                                 
  ===========                                                                 
  There is a system of calibration lamps associated with the                  
  adapter/rotators at the NTT which can be used for most of the               
  wavelength calibrations required for the EMMI data.  The main               
  component of the calibration system is an integrating sphere mounted        
  on the side of the adapter.  Light from the output aperture of the          
  integrating sphere passes a lens and is reflected to the center of          
  the focal plane by a 45 degree mirror which is moved to the optical         
  axis. On the integrating sphere He, Ar, and ThAr lamps are mounted,         
  while the light of flatfield and other spectral lamps that are              
  mounted in a rack on the floor is fed to the sphere through an              
  optical fibre.  The fiber induces some broad absorption features            
  around 724 micron and 880 micron which do not occur in the                  
  scientific data.  The angular size, location, and shape (including          
  central obscuration) of the NTT exit pupil are approximately                
  simulated.  The illumination is homogeneous and unvignetted in a 3          
  arc min by 6 arc min field and is still usable in a field of 5 arc          
  min by 8 arc min which is the maximum field size for MOS.                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Processing                                                                  
  ==========                                                                  
  The data from the EMMI and SUSI detectors are simultaneously                
  transmitted to IHAP and MIDAS databases.  MIDAS runs on a Unix              
  workstation equipped with a DAT tape unit. IHAP uses standard 1/2           
  inch 2400~foot tapes at 6250 BPI with a total capacity of 45 by 1024        
  times 1024 images in FITS format.                                           
                                                                              
  The FITS headers of CCD files contain all the information necessary         
  for the scientific use of the data, that is all the telescope,              
  instrument, and detector parameters. Most of these parameters are           
  stored in so-called hierarchical keywords. MIDAS can read these             
  keywords, but some other packages may not since these are an                
  extension of the FITS standard. If you are not using MIDAS, it is           
  worth to check the actual FITS header for further information which         
  may be useful.                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Electronics                                                                 
  ===========                                                                 
  The NTT is controlled by two HP1000/A900 computers, one for the             
  telescope (called NTT) and one for the instruments (called NTI).            
  The control software of EMMI is organized in such a way that EMMI is        
  presented as five sub-instruments called RILD, REMD, BIMG, BLMD, and        
  DIMD.  Depending on the type of observations, the user selects one          
  of these modes and the control software automatically moves the             
  functions to be set for this mode.  This leaves only the parameters         
  of the particular type of observation to be defined.  For instance,         
  when setting up an exposure in RILD, the required mirror unit and           
  the upper red folding mirror are automatically set. The observer            
  must only specify the camera focus, the choice of slit, filter              
  and/or grism, and exposure parameters (see section Getting                  
  started).                                                                   
                                                                              
  The user interface (UIF) consists of a RAMTEK monitor where mouse           
  driven menus and forms are displayed, and a CRT (LU:53) monitor             
  where messages from the system about the instrument are given and           
  commands may be entered.  Parameters are entered by filling in forms        
  on the RAMTEK screen.                                                       
                                                                              
  Once all optional optical elements are installed by the operation           
  group, according to the observer's request, a setup form is                 
  produced. A printout of this form is left in the control room so            
  that the observer can verify the setup and can use it as reference          
  during the night.  The positions in the wheels of filters,                  
  grisms,and slits, and the gratings in the housing will be displayed,        
  on the RAMTEK UIF in sofar as it is used in the chosen mode,                
  whenever a setup in that mode is defined.

  The pointing of the NTT is better than 1.5 arcsec rms. Guiding the          
  telescope is normally done by the night assistant by centering a            
  star on one of the two guide probes in the adapter and starting the         
  autoguider.                                                                 
                                                                              
  The camera on the blue arm of EMMI is at F/4 and the detector               
  presently used is a TEK CCD of 1024x1024 pixels, 24 micron in size          
  (ESO No  31).  This gives a scale of 0.37 arcsec/pixel and a field          
  of view of 6.2 by 6.2 arcmin.                                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Ancillary Data                                                              
  ==============                                                              
  Bias and darks                                                              
  --------------                                                              
  It is not safe to assume the bias to be always a scalar and                 
  therefore it is recommended to take many bias exposures.                    
                                                                              
  It has proven to be extremely difficult to isolate the CCD                  
  electronics from electrical interference from components in the NTT         
  adapters/rotators. Therefore to some extent, the EMMI CCDs show             
  pick-up patterns in the electronic background (the bias).  This             
  noise is minimized in  SLOW readout mode, but may be rather strong          
  in FAST readout frames. The patterns are not stable, but change from        
  one exposure to the next, so it is difficult to remove them                 
  completely by substracting bias frames.  However, some reduction can        
  be achieved and, therefore, it is recommended to take a good number         
  of bias frames throughout the observing run.  Should strong patterns        
  (i.e. more than a few ADUs) appear on SLOW readout bias frames, call        
  the NTT coordinator (93-50).  Note that spurious patterns are               
  introduced if images are displayed with demagnification factors.            
                                                                              
  At least one, but preferably more, long (1 hour) dark exposures             
  should be taken to monitor the dark current and any exposure                
  dependent features.                                                         
                                                                              
  Flat fields                                                                 
  -----------                                                                 
  The linearity of CCD No 31 is very good up to 160,000 e/pixel.  The         
  most accurate results for flat fields in broad band imaging are             
  obtained using sky flats. This may be achieved by median filtering          
  of science images, if they are not too densely populated with stars         
  and do not contain very extended objects, or by doing multiple              
  exposures of sparsely populated fields, using spatial offsets. A            
  list of such fields is available in the control room. Another               
  approach is to use morning and evening twilight.                            
                                                                              
  Shutter timing                                                              
  --------------                                                              
  A time delay of 0.80 seconds has been measured for the shutter in           
  the blue F/4 camera.  Because of the location of the shutter in the         
  optical path, the exposure time over the field is constant and equal        
  to the chosen time plus the average shutter delay.  If critical for         
  your application, it is recommended that you check the shutter              
  timing by either taking exposures of increasing duration on a star,         
  or using one of the internal lamps and a pinhole in the aperture            
  wheel.                                                                      
                                                                              
  Typical count rates

  In blue imaging the efficiency of EMMI is the product of the                
  transmission of the atmosphere, three reflections in the telescope,         
  the transmission of the blue coated optics of mode BIMG, filter, and        
  quantum efficiency of the CCD. The efficiency in B and U was checked        
  for the F/4 camera and TEK CCD No 31 in 1993.  The count rates in           
  e/sec deduced for a 15th magnitude A star with approximately zero           
  colour are U: 2200, B: 16,900 at unit airmass.
