    The Neutral Particle Imager (NPI) measures integral ENA fluxes    
    in the energy range 0.1 to 60 keV to help satisfy the following   
    scientific objectives:                                            
                                                                      
       1. Determine the instantaneous global distributions of plasma  
          and neutral gas near Mars                                   
                                                                      
       2. Energy deposition from the solar wind to the ionosphere     
                                                                      
       3. Search for the solar wind-Phobos interactions

    All NPI data products have the same format and parameters, and    
    each row (data file record) in the NPI SPREADSHEET data products  
    has eight (8) COLUMN objects (parameters):                        
       1. Start Time - Begin Date/Time in UTC of data samples         
       2. Stop Time - Ending Date/Time in UTC of data samples         
       3. Data Type Name - either SENSOR or MODE. The SENSOR rows are 
          the NPI science data for each sector (32 sectors). The MODE 
          rows contains informational data like Accumulation Time and 
          MCP Mode.                                                   
       4. Data Type Id - Numeric ID indicating either SENSOR or MODE. 
       5. Data Name - Short description for data on that row.  For    
          example 'Sector 0' for NPI sector 0 science data (SENSOR    
          row), or 'Accumulation Time' for informational data (MODE   
          row).                                                       
       6. Data Unit - Indicates the data unit (c/sec for SENSOR data, 
          unitless for MODE data).                                    
       7. Values - These are the actual data values.  For NPI, there  
          is one value per row (sector).                              
       8. Data Quality Value - Quality indicator for the data on that 
          row. See CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE under 'Data                  
          Coverage/Quality' for valid                                 
          values and descriptions.

       1. NPINORM_C_SEC - Neutral Particle Imager NORMal mode data in 
          Counts / SECond (count rate).

    It is important for ASPERA-3 science studies to know where in     
    space and time the Mars Express spacecraft and ASPERA-3           
    instruments are located and what objects (Sun, Mars, Earth,       
    Phobos, Deimos) are in the fields of views. The ASPERA-3 view     
    directions for each sensor can be derived using the SPICE kernels 
    and software. The ASPERA-3 Sensor Frames and Geometry Information 
    document (in DOCUMENT directory) provides a code example (in C    
    and FORTRAN) for determining the view directions for the ASPERA-3 
    sensors.                                                          
                                                                      
    Coordinate System:

    The ASPERA-3 data are always in the instrument reference frame    
    since data are sampled in situ. The GEOMETRY table contains       
    spacecraft related parameters expressed in the J2000 reference    
    frame, and the ASPERA-3 Sensor Frames and Geometry Information    
    document (in DOCUMENT directory) provides information for         
    determining the ASPERA-3 sensors view directions and transforming 
    to the J2000 reference frame.
