   DESCRIPTION    = "Spacecraft time in integer seconds that is transmitted
   to the MESSENGER subsystems by the Integrated Electronics Module. This is
   assigned as the start time of the UVVS observation. A UVVS observation is
   defined as all the scan data contained within one UVVS science packet.
   This is due to the highly configurable nature of the instrument, i.e. it
   can be commanded to take multiple scans over multiple wavelengths. Unit is
   in mission elapsed time which is the number of seconds since launch. PER
