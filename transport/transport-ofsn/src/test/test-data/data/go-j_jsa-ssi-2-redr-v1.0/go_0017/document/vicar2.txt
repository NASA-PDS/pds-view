INTRODUCTION

This file describes the organization and content of the Galileo SSI flight
label for REDR and EDR images.  This label is based on the Video Image
Communication and Retrieval (VICAR) image processing label standard.  Label
items, their meanings and values, are described in this document.

                    procedure listed under the respective task

GALILEO SSI FLIGHT LABEL

The following is the latest memorandum describing the SSI VICAR label for
Jupiter Orbiatal Operations (Phase 2) and retains Cruise (Phase 1) 
information. The memorandum describes both the SSI Ground-Calibration label 
and the Flight label.  PDS labels contained in this CD-ROM data set are 
flight labels.

INTRODUCTION:  This memo documents the format and contents of the Galileo
SSI ground-calibration label and flight image label for both cruise 
(Phase 1) and Jupiter Obital Operations (Phase 2).  The purpose of these
labels and requirements for label maintenance are also addressed. 

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT LABEL:  All digital images stored in standard VICAR
format are preceded by a picture label.  The label consists of picture
descriptors and processing history information stored in ASCII.

Flight projects have traditionally designed special label formats to
identify the mission, spacecraft, instrument, target, and frame, and to
include various camera and image geometry information pertinent to the 
interpretation of the image.  The project labels are attached to each new
image received via the real-time system, or ground-calibration
tapes.  Consequently, these labels normally precede all other labels.
This memo is concerned specifically with these project labels, and does not
address other labels added by VICAR or application programs during process-
ing.

During systematic and science processing, individual programs may extract
and use various image identifiers and camera parameters stored in the 
label.  The image geometry information included in the label is ignored
during processing, since more accurate information is available in the
project SEDR or SPICE files.

As each new version of an image is produced, the VICAR system will
automatically copy the picture label and add the program name, user name,
and date to the processing history.  In addition, individual programs
may add processing information to the label.

The image label may be printed by executing LABLIST or LABEL-LIST on the
image.  Unless a rigid file-name nomenclature is adhered to, this image
label is the only means of identifying an image stored on disk.

GALILEO SSI GROUND-CALIBRATION LABEL:  The ground-calibration picture label
is generated by program VGLLOG, which reads tapes generated by the Galileo 
Sensor Test Set (STS) and converts the file to standard VICAR image format.

Appendix 1 presents a brief description of each label item.  The ground-
calibration label follows a convention used to support old label formats
originally used on the IBM (before 1984).  The project labels are stored
as label items LAB01, LAB02, LAB03, etc.  Each LABXX item consists of
a 72-character ASCII strings.  The 71st character is a label type flag used 
by some programs (e.g. MASKV) to control which labels are displayed or 
printed.  The last character in each string is a 'C' (for continue) or 'L'
(for last).  However, note that the additional label item NLABS should be 
used to indicate how many project labels are present.

GALILEO SSI FLIGHT LABEL:  The flight label is in free format, with each 
label item stored in the form "keyword=value".  A brief description of each
label item is provided in Appendix 2 for Phase 1 and for Phase 2.

Summation-mode frames can be identified by their 2 1/3 frame rate and
15-1/6 frame rate (added for Phase 2).  The majority of the label 
items are generated by the Real-Time subsystem's Image-Builder program.  
Label items DC, CAL, SO, BLM, IOF, CNV, and UBWC are added by GALSOS.  
If the image is read from an EDR tape, label items EDRTAPE and EDRFILE are 
added by GEDREAD.  EDRTAPE and EDRFILE are no longer used with files
archived on CD-ROM.

When an image is map-projected, the following label items relating to
image geometry must be updated (by MAP3):  SUNAZ, SMRAZ, SCAZ, NORAZ,
SMR, LAT, LON, HSCL, VSCL.  This is not currently implemented.

The program LABLIST has been written to list the label items in a 
standard format at the terminal or on hardcopy.  (NOTE: See Appendix 2 
for a complete list of Phase 2 label-items.  At publication time, the 
program LABLIST had not been modified to read and format the most recent
additions.)  The following is the format for a Phase 1 image:

APPLICATION PROGRAM/LABEL INTERFACES:  Label items may be stored, retrieved,
or deleted via subroutines XLADD, XLGET, or XLDEL, respectively.  Subroutine
VIC1LAB may be used to retrieve all ground-calibration labels.  The subroutine
ABLE86 will extract specific information from either flight or ground- 
calibration labels and return the results in an array (e.g. filter position).
Note that programs that support more than one mission (e.g. Voyager and 
Galileo) should not call ABLE86 directly, but use GETLABCON instead.

Notes:
1)  Sources are:
      RAW=ssiraw table of database
      RTS=real time system,
      VIEW=ssioverview table of database,
      ICT=ssiict table of database,
      OPNAV=ssiopnav table of database,
      GALSOS=radiometric correction program,
      SPICE=SPICE kernels, typically via the CATLABEL program.
2)  The SCET refers to the shutter center of the shutter event.
3)  If the target is the ring-plane of Jupiter, label items LAT and 
    LON are replaced by RAD and LON.
4)  Prior to JOI, MOFIBE was FIBE and ENCODING_TYPE was BARC.
5)  TBPPXL, TPPLNE apply to BARC compression only.
6)  QUANTIZATION_STEP_SIZE, QUANTIZATION_MATRIX_NAME,
    TRUTH_WINDOW, ICT_DESPIKE_THRESHOLD and ZIGZAG_PATTERN apply to ICT
    Compression only and are defaulted for Huffman (lossless) compressed 
    images.  COMPRESION_RATIO, MINIMUM_COMPRESSION_RATIO, and 
    MAX_COMPRESSION_RATIO apply to ICT and Huffman only (lossless) images.
    CUT_OUT_WINDOW applies to both ICT compression and BARC compression
7)  HUFFMAN_TABLE applies to Huffman only (lossless) and ICT compression 
    images.  Note that ICT compressed images are also HUFMAN compressed 
    but are identified as ICT.
8)  NSTARS,STAR1,STAR2,STAR3,STAR4 and STAR5 apply to OPNAV images only.
9)  All azimuth angles are measured clockwise from right in the image.
10) An image "size field" defines the location and size of an image area.  
    It consists of four numbers: starting line, starting sample, number of 
    lines, and number of samples.  The origin of the image coordinate system 
    is at (LINE,SAMPLE)=(1,1) for the upper-left corner, with samples 
    increasing to the right and lines increasing downwards.
11) INA, EMA, PHA, HRA, SMEAR, HSCL, VSCL, LAT, LON, and RAD are for the 
    center of the image if all four corner lie on the target, otherwise
    it is at the target center if visible, otherwise the image is scanned
    at 20 pixel intervals for a point at highest resolution.
12) The J2000 coordinate system is used for all orientation calculations.

Application program label interface:  Label items may be stored, retrieved, 
or deleted via subroutines XLADD, XLGET, or XLDEL, respectively.  Subroutine 
VIC1LAB may be used to retrieve all ground-calibration labels.  The subroutine
ABLE86 will extract data from either flight or ground-calibration labels and 
return the values in an array.  Note that programs intended for multimission 
support should not call ABLE86 directly, but use GETLABCON instead.  

When an image is map-projected, the following label items relating to image 
geometry are updated by MAP3:  SUNAZ, SMRAZ, SCAZ, NORAZ, SMRAZ, LAT, LON, 
HSCL, VSCL.  This is not yet implemented.
